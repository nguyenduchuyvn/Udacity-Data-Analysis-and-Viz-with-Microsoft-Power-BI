# **Market Analysis Report for National Clothing Chain**

Project 3 of Udacity's [Data Analysis and Visualization with Microsoft Power BI Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-and-visualization-with-power-BI-nanodegree--nd331)
in **Advanced Data Analysis with Power BI** course.

## Project Description:
An online national clothing chain needs help on creating a targeted marketing campaign. 

Sales have been flat and they want to lure lost customers back. They want to advertise specific products to specific customers in specific locations, 
but they don’t know who to target. They have three products in mind:
- Shirt: $25
- Sweater: $100
- Leather Bag: $1,000
They need us to conduct an analysis to determine the best product to advertise to each customer.

## Project Instruction
In this project, we will use population statistics from the US Census Bureau to determine where the greatest income exists around the country 
and whether there is a correlation between sales and income. We don’t know the incomes of our customers, but we should be able to predict it 
by looking at their purchase history and locations and comparing that against the census data. 
Additionally, we want to analyze our inventory, specifically customer ratings and return rate and see if there’s a correlation between the two.
